    <h1>Our animals</h1>
        <p>Take a look at all of our cute animals that we have for adoption!</p>
    <h2>George</h2>
        <img scr="George.jpeg" alt="image of chihuahua">
        <p>George was brought to us after a tornado hit Portland. He was found wandering Division street by a lovely fanmily who unfortunately already had ten chihuahuas at home. He has lots of personality and loves belly rubs:)</p>

    <h2>Henry</h2>

        <p>Henry is an odd fellow who makes a great buddy!</p>

    <h2>Fiona</h2>

        <p>Fiona is the spark of the shelter! She has bounds of energy and needs lots of stimulation. We hope to find Fiona a home with a large yard and no other pets at home. No kids please!</p>
